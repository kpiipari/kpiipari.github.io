I'm so excited to have finished my Rails App with a JQuery Front End - project. I got really into a flow on the final hurdle when I was fixing a bunch of bugs that had been there from the beginning. All just seemed to finally click in my head. I have learned so much about Rails, JQuery, Javascript, DOM...what an amazing feeling.
