title:  Why did you decide to learn software development?

I have been learning a bit of code here and there for about 10 years or so. I have tried a bit of JavaScript, Ruby, Python, Swift and even a bit of C. After I finished my PhD in biomedical sciences, I started to work for a small start up company doing customer support and later testing the software product. Gradually, my role grew more and more technical -- and I loved it. I learned to use git and terminal commands, write Gherkin BDD specs, use Xcode, read crash reports etc. 

I was (and still am) testing native Mac, iOS and Windows applications, all of which require a lot of manual testing. I became interested in automated UI testing (since Apple started to offer this with Xcode 7 and above) and thinking of ways how I could automate some of the other testing aspects as well. In order to achive this, I need to be able to read and write test scripts that can be written with JavaScript and Ruby for instance. 

The role of a QA analyst in a tech company can vary enourmously. Some 'testers' are very hands on manual testers and some are actual developer-turned-testers. I decided to learn software development as I want to grow my skills as a QA analyst and to have a role towards becoming a developer in testing, and eventually a software developer.

Beside the fact that learning software development is something that helps in my current job and my future career in general, I think learning is so much fun. It can be challenging at times but as it has been over 10 years since I graduated with a Bachelor's degree and over 7 years since I finished my PhD, I actually crave the challenge and stimuli to learn and once again graduate, this time as a full stack web developer :)
